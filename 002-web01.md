# Web example

## What is it

The goal is to build a simple web server application that returns a message when hitting the target port.

Looking at this, it's similar to standard Node and Express patterns with a golang twist.

* Set up a route handler
* Start a server

## Workspaces

I'm building different small programs in the same repo. To do that, I need a `go.work` file to define the workspace.

I ended up in the terminal running `go work --help`. After reading the help, I moved to the workspace root and ran `go work use logfilter01 web01` to add the two modules to the workspace. The result was a workspace file (which is in `.gitignore`).

`go.work`

```golang
go 1.20

use (
 ./logfilter01
 ./web01
)
```

After setting up the workspace, I was able to `go build .` in `web01` and run the resulting `web01`, which works as expected

**COMMIT: FEAT: build a simple web service that returns "Hello, world."**
